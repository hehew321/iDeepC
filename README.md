## Overview
We present a RBP-specific method iDeepC for predicting RBP binding sites on circRNAs from sequences. iDeepC adopts a Siamese-like neural network consisting of a network module with a lightweight attention and a metric module. The network module with pre-training learns embeddings for a pair of sequences, whose embedding difference is fed to the metric module to estimate the binding potential. iDeepC is able to capture mutual information between circRNAs, and thus mitigate data scarcity for poorly characterized RBPs

## Code details
* iDeepC.py is the main program.
* CRIP_data.py and GraphProt_CLIP_data.py are the data processing script of the RBP-37 (CRIP) and RBP-24 (GraphProt) dataset, respectively.
* CRIP_C22ORF28.h5 and GraphProt_CLIP_C22ORF28_Baltz2012.h5 are the pretrained model parameters for C22ORF28, and they are respectively loaded when training models for individual RBPs in RBP-37 and RBP-24 dataset.

## Dependency

* python3.6

* tensorflow-gpu 1.13.1

* keras 2.3.0

* skearn 0.20.0

* weblogo 3.7.5


## Dataset

* CRIP: RBP-37 for RBP binding circRNAs, it consists of 37 RBP datasets, each  corresponds to one RBP.

* GraphProt_CLIP_sequence: RBP-24 for RBP binding linear RNAs, it consists of 24 datasets, each corresponds to one RBP.


## Usage

* python iDeepC.py [-h] [--dataset DATASET] [--protein_name PROTEIN_NAME]

* Enter the data set and protein name. The default is the CRIP dataset and ALKBH5 protein.



## Identify motifs

* Set draw_motifs to True in the test functionï¼ŒYou can get the .eps file of visual motifs.

* The default saved file address is source directory('./'+protein_name+'.eps').
